The Software Development Life Cycle is the complete process of creating and developing a software application. The SDLC is split into 6 phases:
PHASE I - Requirement Gathering.
PHASE II - Requirements Analysis.
PHASE III - Design and Architecture.
PHASE IV -  Product Building.
PHASE V - Product Testing. 
PHASE VI - Deployment and Maintenace. 

Before writing the code, one must figure out its requirements from the clients. Who will use this application?. What are the expectations from the desired product and whether those expectations are feasible in the application? This whole process of gaining information and research is known as Requirement Gathering. 

Requirement Gathering - PHASE I

Requirement Gathering is knowing what the users what. It is top-level executives asking stakeholders what are the demands and use of this application. Then it is brain-storming features of the application. The importance of Requirement gathering are:
It is the first step of the SDLC 
Developing an app is a huge investment of time, resources, and money. It is absolutely crucial to get the information right. 
This process helps to understand the clients and user needs in detail. 
This process involves analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing software. 
The advantages of Requirement gathering are:
The intention of Clients is clear. This allows the formulation of a basic idea of the product.
It helps in feature refinement. This means it helps in the usability of the product. 
Identify flaws in the requested feature. 
Let's look at a real-life example of how requirement gathering works. To build an application that will help the user's order tests for covid from the comfort of their homes. Further, these results can be consulted by doctors if the test results come out to be positive. These test results can be accessed by a superUser to verify and update the system. The govt authority can set a threshold in certain areas, and divide it into Red -Danger, Yellow - Containimation, or Green - Safe zones. And according to the zones, the govt authorities can impose a lockdown. 

The four major roles in this application are: 
User
Tester
Doctor
Govt Authority. 

Requirement Analysis - PHASE II 

This phase is important because it refines the information gathered and helps create one single platform for each of the roles. The application will be of help to users, testers, doctors, and govt. This requires a workflow. 
A workflow is an informal sequence of steps in order to determine which step comes after the present one. These step needs a high-level approach and can be understood by a layman. 

The workflow for this application is: 
User requests for a test.
The tester from the lab visits the home of the requestee. 
The test is conducted and samples are collected. Also, the patient personal and ID details are collected. 
The test is taken back to the lab and the test is analyzed. 
The results are stored in a database. 
If the tests come back to be positive, a doctor is consulted for further steps and precautions. 
Once the data is stored in on the database, the govt authority acting as the superUser to this app can classify and add parameters such as lockdown in certain areas depending on the data. 
This workflow can be depicted pictorially. This pictorial depiction is known as Use Case Diagrams. It is also a mindmap for the entire application. It is the representation of how users interact with the system and shows the relationship between the different users of the app. 

Use Cases are actions that a user is entitled to perform. 
These are events defining the interaction between an actor and a system to achieve a goal.
The importance of Use Case Diagrams are: 
A  software document can be highly technical and lengthy. While reading through the entire document, one can miss out on some features that may hamper the development of the application. A use case diagram is very easy to understand and gives a high-level overview of the application. 
The easy use of this use-case diagram helps in reducing costs as no features are left out. 
 Reducing development efforts. Features that are important and not important can easily be identified. 
Identification of flaws and risks is easy. 
A possible idea of the final product can be seen with the help of this diagram.

The Use Cases lead to Mock UI. A mock UI is a simple drawing which states what screen will come next while using the application. It is a visualization of content at a high level. A mock UI is will be different for different roles in the application. Taking the health app into consideration, the User, Doctor, Tester, and Govt Authority will all have different UI's. 

A Control Flow of the application will help you create a better Mock UI design. A control flow is nothing but a flowchart of the application. The flowchart states which process happens after the previous one. 

A web application is divided into three main parts: 

Back End - Web Servers: What data will be stored and the logic of the application is written here. 
Front End - UI Experience: The Users will interact with the app here. 
DataBases - Where all information is stored.
